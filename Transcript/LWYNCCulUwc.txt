hey folks I guess we are life let me
just check the stream quality could you
also please confirm if everything the
both audio is clear and as far as the
video is concerned that you're able to
see my screen being shared can you
please confirm that
let me also confirm from my side that
there are no hiccups yeah I can hear
myself fairly clearly no major issues
from my side at least I can hear I can
see also the screen so cool ok sounds
good
ok so one thing that I wanted to mention
anyway let's wait for a few minutes for
everyone to join but in a nutshell I'll
try to so I went through the chat window
from yesterday's discussion I'll try to
cover an answer some of the good
questions from yesterday's live chat
window using some examples little later
also some some of the participants
suggested some good functions to cover
which I will be covering in today's
session right so I just wanted to
mention that ok so everything is clear
good so please understand that in a in a
live session with with so many students
and so many participants it's hard to
answer everyone's questions in a live
session because unlike a class if it's a
physical class people will raise their
hand and ask question all that would
happen here it's it's very different
right so it's so easy to put in a
question but it's so hard to answer
because of time constraints so what I
have done today is I'll cover a few
topics that I wanted to complete in
objected programming then I have picked
up a few good questions from yesterday's
live chat window also a few suggestions
from yesterday's live chat window and
I'll try to cover some of those things
and very importantly a huge thank you to
all the people who are answering in the
chat window while I am not able to
answer I see that for some questions I
see other participants giving very good
answers thank you very much I mean
you're helping everyone here thanks a
lot and
yeah so I'll try to cover some of these
again please understand that in a live
session of this scale it's very hard to
answer every question that comes here
but we'll try our best sounds good
okay let me take a few general questions
then I will go into c+
so not C++ sorry then I'll go into
Python object on programming
specifically right so so somebody is
asking we are passing in variable and
map function in the map function it just
calls in twice it so so the logic here
is just look at the again whenever you
have a doubt like this so just ipython
map function all right so first read the
documentation there is a documentation
for this function reference right so
okay Python reference ah no no read the
doc sorry I want to read this
documentation again I prefer reading the
you asked about map right I guess you
asked about map if I'm not wrong you
asked about map function right so let's
look at the map function itself in the
map function the first thing that we
pass is a function again here we are not
again if one question one very common
misconception that people have let me
just open my writer so lot of again the
question that you asked was map we just
pass int here and some I terrible object
right why are we not calling so your
question here is why are we not doing
this map int comma and I terrible so the
way it works is every function so all
you in the function place all you need
to give is the name of the function
right the parameters to the function are
taken from this I terrible object itself
each of the elements in this I terrible
object imagine there is a list here
right so imagine if I have this map in
to imagine if I have a list 1 2 3 so
list is an eye trouble object right so
the way it works is the parameters of
int so it will call the int function
which is basically a typecasting
function which costs everything into an
integer it will take each of these as
parameters now your question here is why
do we not need the parentheses here
because that's how the function is
find internally again this is something
that you might appreciate if you know
compiler design or in this case the
interpreter design so internally Python
stores every function okay how does
Python store internally functions Python
basically in your RAM when python loads
a function this these are the lines of
code that that are part of a function
and there is something called as a
symbol table
okay these are stuff that you learn when
you go to the internals of python right
in the symbol table where where all the
variables all the functions all the
objects everything is stored actually so
the way python stores this is that there
is a function called int and some other
information about this function
including the location where if it wants
to execute this function where in memory
again this is your RAM again this also
symbol table is also in the RAM by the
way right so what it says here if I want
to execute the int function where do I
go in the RAM to execute each of the
lines of the code right because the this
function code itself is loaded into the
RAM as part of the loader right so the
way the symbol table is storing is
symbol table just towards the name of
the function without the parenthesis
that's why the designers of the
designers of Python just said just give
me the function name I'll make it work
because in my symbol table I just have
the function name I don't care about the
parameters the parameters or the
parenthesis you don't require to give
the balances because that's how it is
defined that's why it's always important
to read the documentation carefully
again if you don't understand symbol
table all of that that's okay right of
course see there are layers of
understanding for any programming
language right so what we're trying to
do is maybe the first two layers of
internals but then if you really want to
understand if you really want to go in
depth and understand the programming
language you will have to read the
internal documentation internal
implementation specifics you have to
know quite a lot of computer science in
terms of compiler design etc right so
again this is the simplest way again you
just don't have to give the whole
function name that's all okay sounds
good
so somebody says can we discuss some
interview questions around opie acid in
ml interviews again I have
I have not seen anybody asking at least
I don't recall myself maybe there are a
few cases but I don't recall cases where
people would ask object-oriented
programming specific questions in the
context of ML interviews because in ml
interviews I mean even in top product
based companies I don't recall any
specific object or programming specific
stuff of course if you're if you've
worked as a software engineer if you've
worked as a software development
engineer for a few years and then you
are transitioning to machine learning
roles right then and if the machine
learning roles involves lot of
engineering or software engineering work
typically there is this round called as
low level design right so low level
design or object design round this is
the round in which a lot of again this
is not asked to fresh up software
engineers also this is typically asked
to software development engineer two or
three right so these are people with at
least a few years of experience in
software or software development and who
know the basics of objective design and
low level design so especially at
companies like Amazon Google Facebook
all the top product based companies for
software engineer to role or software
engineer three role right two or three
they would have a round called low level
design where they would actually ask the
object or programming concepts and
object a design specific stuff like
design principles etc or or design
patterns and things like that for
machine learning roles you typically
have one or two rounds of programming
interview and then you would have mostly
rest of the four or five rounds as
mostly machine learning specific rounds
you could have one round or data
analysis one round in probability
statistics one round of machine learning
will depth practical applications
etcetera etcetera even this programming
round will will revolve a lot on
mathematical aspects of programming a
lot and if you come from CS background
there might be some data structures and
algorithms also very seldom I've at
least I don't recall any case where
specifically object programming stuff
was asked to machine learning engineers
or machine learning scientists or data
scientists unless they work their
software engineers in the prior role
where they were doing software design
right so if your prior experience
involves object under design then they
would say okay let's test where he
stands on
design right sounds good Oh anyway it's
already six or six so let's get started
again let me just clarify a couple of
things
so today the way we are going to run is
slightly different from the previous
days I'm going to cover a bunch of
concepts that are still left in ovulated
programming I went through yesterday's
live chat window a couple of things some
of you mentioned that that the
instructor is not answering all the
questions it's not possible right in a
live chat like this it's almost
impossible to answer every question so
we try our best to answer a few
questions so it's its first and foremost
it's important to recognize that it's
not possible to answer every question
because if you start answering these
questions we will not be able to cover
what we wanted to cover right number one
and that's why we we have some general
Q&A sessions that we conduct so we have
general Q&A sessions that we conduct
every now and then where the objective
is just only to answer questions that
come in the live chat window even in
that week we are often it's often
impossible to cover every question but
we try so in the general Q&A sessions
probably we can cover more questions
from the live chat window than in an
information session like this number one
number two is what I've also very
importantly there are a few volunteers I
don't know I don't know what to call
them and a very few good netizens who
are answering others questions thanks a
lot thank you very much I can't thank
you enough because whatever I could not
answer some of these volunteers I mean
these are these are just other viewers
like you they're not somebody that we
selected and all that no these are just
other viewers who are answering good
questions thanks a lot you're doing a
great job thank you very much
the third thing that I thought of was I
went through the live chat window
yesterday I took some of the key and
very good questions and also good ideas
that others have suggested like one of
our viewer suggested I forgot the name
that why don't we use the Dare function
a very useful idea so what I'm doing now
is once I finish these concepts I will
cover a few key questions that I saw in
yesterday's live chat window again for
each of these questions I've written a
snippet of code and I will try to
explain with
but of course and I'd also teach you how
to answer the questions yourself by just
writing a snippet of code I'll also
cover the few good ideas that others
have suggested in the chat window
yesterday this is how we'll go okay
first let's finish some of the concepts
that I wanted to cover then I will cover
all the questions if time permits we'll
cover more questions right cool
again we covered a big chunk yesterday
that's why I couldn't that's why I
couldn't answer many questions yesterday
okay so one of the very popular
questions that that I've seen repeatedly
are being us I thought I'll cover that
first is how is obtained water
programming typically used in an ml role
in the industry typically again I'm
saying typically because every ml role
is different right there are some ml
rows the roles where you do more of
research work there are some ml roles
where you do more of engineering work so
it depends on the role itself right but
most often you use existing classes I
showed an example yesterday for a
matplotlib right so whether you use a
mat plot lab whether you use
scikit-learn whether you use tensor flow
you use a bunch of very specialized
libraries that are meant for plotting
statistics numerical operations machine
learning deep learning you mostly use
existing classes so you have to know
what is a class what is the object basic
understanding right cool
second thing that you often do at least
this is what I have done in over a
decade of experience in a wide spectrum
of roles so reading documentation to
understand how to use the functions
classes and modules right this is this
is something that you do see again the
the the functions modules classes they
evolved for example there is this module
called c1 that did not exist just a few
years ago when I was when I was working
and writing production quality code or
even research quality code right so
whenever new modules like this come it
is our job to read the documentation and
understand the functions the classes and
the whole module so that we can use it
tomorrow right and nothing beats that to
read the documentation you need basic
understanding of objective programming
cool the third one is to fix bugs and to
understand error messages
right suppose you are using something
from tensorflow okay you get an error
message some error message you have to
know what is an attribute you have to
know what is a method you have to know
those basic stuff right so it is
extremely useful in get in fixing code
bugs and understanding error messages
this is what I have done extending
existing classes to modify some
functionality in an existing class okay
I've showed you this example yesterday
right yesterday I showed you about my
URL shortener right my URL shortener and
this was my URL shortener was was the
subclass or it was the derived class
from short URL final I've shown you
imagine if this was there in some
library or module how can I modify it to
the needs that I want again what we'll
do in the future sessions is we will see
how to extend existing classes in
machine learning libraries for example
we'll take let's say logistic regression
okay I mean I'm just giving an example
right so logistic regression is a very
popular machine learning model that is
implemented in scikit-learn
so right so we will create a child class
or we'll derive a class from logistic
regression modify some functionality of
logistic regression right and this is
something that is often done because you
want to modify maybe you want to modify
a specific implementation of a function
or you think this implementation is not
good you want to change some
implementation specifics that happens a
lot right next you also work a lot with
software engineers to build ml classes
so for example imagine you're building a
huge product or a service this is a huge
product that you're building the
software engineers the software
architects they write a lot of code this
is all the code that they've written but
they need somebody to implement a
machine learning class right or the
let's assume this is the machine
learning functionality that you need to
write so they might ask a machine
learning engineer or a data scientist or
a machine learning scientist saying hey
can you please implement this class with
these functions and these functions
should be doing this and we will call
these functions from our code again a
lot of production quality code is
written by software engineers so your
job is to implement a class with some
specific functionality
they ask you right so here again
remember you're not doing object related
design you are working with experienced
software engineers in writing the
machine learning module because because
the software engineers may not know how
the machine learning internals work
right so you work extensively with
software engineers to build machine
learning classes for them to use in a
larger software again very importantly a
lot of people do this mistake please do
not perform observe object-oriented
design this is what I meant when I said
low-level design
I mentioned this earlier right so low
level design is is typically an
interview round that is conducted for
software development engineer two or
three at Amazon and other similar
companies it is again and not around
that is meant for freshers right so even
even for are also called as principal
engineers right so most of these guys
have a low-level design interviewer on
where they mostly do object-oriented
design using something called as design
principles again this is typically done
by senior engineers or architects in a
role if you do not know object-oriented
design please don't do it because if you
do not design it properly it's a mess
those of you who want to learn design
patterns and who want to learn how to
design there is a very nice book from
órale which I have linked here again
this is a completely tangential topic
this is not a topic in machine learning
this is a topic in software design again
this is one of the simplest and a really
good book that I love again there are
many other more complex books but I'm
but I'm linking you to a beginners book
so if you want to learn how to do
object-oriented design using design
patterns this I think is one of the best
books for a beginner level there are
more advanced books etc but this is a
very good with lots of real real with
real examples I really love this book
it's a great beginner book that I have
recommended earlier also cool so I hope
this this makes it clear again as
somebody was asking in most machine
learning roles you are typically not
asked in interviews object unit
programming as much unless you evolved
as a software development engineer for a
few years or a Software Architect for a
few years and you know a lot of imp
imitation specifics right again if your
vault as a software development engineer
for five plus years people expect you to
know some basics of object-oriented
design so in such a case they might say
okay since he has worked for so long can
we also test him on a low-level design
or lld or object-oriented design right
but if you if you have not worked as a
software development engineer for at
least five years I don't think people
will ask you object-oriented design or
object principles for a machine learning
rule again in the machine learning role
this is the lowest priority in terms of
interview okay just wanted to make that
clear again I have interviewed people
with five even 10 15 years of experience
for machine learning roles and in none
of these interview roles I recall a case
where somebody was asked objected
programming specific stuff I don't
recall personally cool sounds good so
let's get into multiple inheritance love
okay so what is multiple inheritance
okay so we talked about inheritance
yesterday right so imagine if I have a
Class A right I inherited into Class B
how do I do it
I just say Class B and within the
parentheses if I say a this becomes my
inherited or my derived class this
becomes my base class we have seen this
now interestingly there is also a
concept called as multiple inheritance
again this is there and most object on
route programming languages like C++ and
of course it's implemented differently
in different programming languages but
this concept exists right so the idea
here is this so the syntax is this class
the derived class name and I can derive
it from multiple parent classes so the
way it will work is this imagine if I
have let's say let's say I have Class A
I have Class B and I have Class C now I
can create Class D and I can derive it
from Class A Class B and Class C so all
the all all the members all the
attributes and methods that are there in
a are inherited by D similarly
everything that is in B is also
inherited everything in C is also
inherited but a quick question is what
if I mean this is obvious question right
suppose imagine there is a function f
here there is also a function f here
same function
right or same method name or some same
variable name which of these is love is
now is now actually inherited into D
because it has the same function name
what happens in such cases those are the
interesting cases in multiple
inheritance again multiple inheritance
while it's a beautiful concept in object
design this is much less used than
simple inheritance in practice even an
object under design okay cool because
there are lots of complexities that you
can get into multiple inheritance I show
you one such complexity okay again this
is a simple toy example I've taken the
code from over IQ and modified it
slightly okay so look at this okay let's
write the structure here okay so I have
a class a which has this function called
explore right so I have Class A which
has the function called explore let's
write this down I have Class B again
Class B is not inheriting from anything
so I have Class B which means Class B
inherits from object let us not forget
that right
it has search and explore it has two
functions search and explore it has two
functions or two methods alright so you
have C C has something called as a
discover again remember all these three
we should not forget that all these
three are actually inheriting from
object right because the default class
from which everything inherits is object
in Python let's not forget that right
so now next thing look at my syntax of
class D so class D ABC right so Class D
inherits from a the order here is very
important it first inherits from a then
from B then from C the order is very
very important okay so it inherits first
this second this third this now comes a
very interesting question so what
happens enough okay so here comes a very
interesting question okay let me show
you the output also okay it's very
simple actually it's very it's very
simple to understand again multiple
inheritance can be extremely complex in
other programming languages python try
to make it fairly simple and
straightforward okay so let me get a
different color a slightly brighter
color just give me a second if I can get
ok this color is also cool this is green
right yeah this is good so I create
an object so the object is basically an
object of type D right so when I say so
so remember D is an object of type class
D now when act where I call D or D
object okay sorry I should just call it
D obj okay when I call Explorer when I
call Explorer remember there is an
explorer in a there is an explorer in B
which Explorer should call okay so the
the the python implementation the Python
documentation or the programming
language implementer said whatever is
there first in this order that will get
a preference
so this Explorer will execute here for
example in this case so again Explorer
is there in both the cases so when I say
Explorer it will because the order I
told you just a while ago right then the
order is important because a is before B
is explorer will be inherited by D not
B's explorer so for example in Asics
ploor if you notice what is the code
that we have so def explorer i am
creating a method where i am saying
explore in a call I'm just printing this
so the moment I call the D object dot
explore what it prints is this explore
in a called
that's how it should behave right so
this basically returns this so remember
the order here is very important okay
left to right that's the important
portion here okay again you can see this
in in the documentation also for example
if you go to I showed you the dock
earlier right Python classes
documentation okay in this tutorial also
they have this okay multiple inheritance
look at this it clearly says in this
document also okay you can okay so okay
so
oh there is also another case there is
depth first and left to right right so
the meaning the meaning between so it
always so if I'm given these three it
goes from left to right now what does
this depth first mean here imagine
imagine a scenario like this imagine I
have a b c and i have d d is derived
from ABC right now a let's assume is
derived from x they just say let just
say right suppose
there is a function f imagine there is a
function f here there is a function f
here there is a function f here there is
no function f here so when now if I say
D equals to this object and if I say D
dot F if I call d dot F which f will get
executed
look at this the order is important it
always goes depth first so D goes to a
it says do you have F no I don't have
deaf but I don't have F but F is there
in my parent so first it goes depth
first it goes depth first right so it
since this F is there this will
basically be equivalent to executing the
F in X the F in class F X so depth first
okay you're going depth so first this
again depth first and left-to-right
that's also important left-to-right you
always go to the leftmost first then if
it has an under bliss class you go
search for that first right so since F
is here left to right that first is the
is the logic here again these types of
multiple inheritances are something that
good object under design should avoid
like very very complex cases they should
avoid because it will make maintaining
code very hard in the real world
but sometimes it's necessary okay so
where were we
okay we were here right so next now if I
if I execute D object search again very
search search is only here so be search
in B is called so this will execute now
if it calls discover okay what happens
if I call discover discover is there
only here so discover will call now with
indeed there is there is another
function or method called test so if I
call test what happens B itself has an
another function called or method called
test so if I call D object or test it
will first check here so first it will
always check so the idea which is very
important here is this first it will
check in the class that I am part of
then from so left to right and depth
first depth first okay first it will
check in the same class first it will
check if it's in the same class
if it's in the same class
cool no problem if it is not in the same
class it first goes to the left in the
order in which you have inherited look
at this it goes to left and if a has
other parent classes it keeps going then
it keeps going depth-first if it is not
there then it goes to the next one next
one and so on and so forth right so
that's again that's how if multiple
inheritance works again multiple
inheritance from a software engineering
perspective from a software design
perspective can be crazy to maintain
again multiple inheritance is is
extremely dangerous that Java actually
comes up with some interesting concepts
because C++ had straightforward multiple
inheritance and when people wrote large
software in C++ multiple inheritance
would create so much of havoc so Java
introduced a concept called interfaces
and things like that to get away with
some of the headaches of C++ multiple
inheritance Python is like okay we we
have a lot of again Python makes the
language simple again Python doesn't
want to have all the complexity of Java
or C++ so they said ok this is a very
simple thing we will have it but from an
object-oriented design standpoint we
recommend that you avoid it unless it is
absolutely necessary right so that's why
there are very few real-world examples
of complex software where it is used it
is used I am NOT saying it's not used
but very few examples okay so next there
is this there is this very deadly
situation called as a deadly diamond
this is a standard problem that you
encounter in multiple inheritance okay
again it's a very standard problem this
is a problem that C++ designers like
it's called the diamond inheritance it's
also referred to as the deadly diamond
problem in in multiple inheritance right
so look at this I have Class A okay
Class A has explored it has a method
called explore then I have Class B Class
B has something called as explore right
again oh sorry sorry my bad my bad I
should draw it carefully so B is it B is
inheriting from a let's not forget that
so you have B here B is a B is
inheriting from a okay so B also has its
own explore each of these explore
functions just say exploring be
exploring a explore NC
right so again you have another class
called C C is also inheriting from a so
you have C C also has explore now you
create D this is where things go crazy
okay now you have D here okay D has no
other implementation D is an empty class
here again this is one other application
of empty classes where if you want to
inherit from multiple classes but you
don't want to implement anything here
okay that's another example of an empty
class which is used sometimes not very
often but sometimes now now let's see
what happens okay so D is empty so now
what I've done here I've created an
object of type class D okay let's call
it D object okay let me change the color
so I have D object here
now when I say D object dot explore what
will run first okay remember it always
does left it up first it checks in the
same class it checks in the same class
then it also follows left to right and
depth first right so this makes life
much more easy in Python okay so it goes
up again my inheritance order is B
followed by C in the same class I don't
have it Explorer is not there so B is
what I have so does explore there in P
yes it is there so I will go executed
first very simple so when I say D object
dot explore explore in B is called again
deadly diamond is a problem that can
make your software design crazy
especially in C++ where there is lot
more complexities in object or
programming in C++ than what you are
seeing in Python right so deadly diamond
is not a very crazy problem in in in
Python specifically again there can be
some boundary cases where things are
crazy
but this is how python operates in a
deadly diamond best or a diamond
inheritance very simple again you can
modify this what if there is no Explorer
here okay let's ask that question what
if there is no Explorer here what should
you do then right so from what I think I
think it should execute a because left
to right parent right so let's actually
try that okay I think it should execute
that
so let me just come into this okay so
now oh yeah me does not have it so what
is that structured enough me does not
have it now if I now if I execute it
what should i what will I get here okay
let me just execute this okay so what we
do do be does not have Explorer D
Explorer is what I am calling so it
should actually print a Explorer
expected indentation sorry I should say
pass if there is nothing I should say
pass my bet Class B pass okay now I
think it should work
oh it's calling and see but it should go
okay okay this is the problem okay so
it's calling and see so one second what
is order here that they say parent class
as a depth-first left-to-right not
searching twice in the same class where
there is an overlap in the hierarchy
okay okay so there's also this case I
forgot yes okay my bad I got it wrong
yeah so it executes see so the way it's
doing it is this look at this it's doing
a depth-first left-to-right again there
is a third case not searching twice in
the same class when there is an overlap
in hierarchy so in our case we have an
overlap in hierarchy right so look at
this in our case where is the diagram we
have an overlap in hierarchy because
this and this both of them have the same
thing there's an overlap in hierarchy
right B's parent class and C's parent
class aren't the same right so there is
an overlap in hierarchy in the case
there is an overlap in hierarchy like
this I forgot to I forgot to read that
point sorry if there is an overlap in
hierarchy it just goes and executes this
again to be honest with you I have never
seen deadly demon being implemented in
production because people know that it's
a tricky case to be honest with you I
fell for it like I assumed that it
should print a but then I forgot to read
this single line again if you forget to
read this single line in the
documentation it's very easy to make a
mistake
so in general multiple inheritance is
filled with potholes if you are not
careful
deadly diamond more so right just a
simple example that I showed you where
where we at least I fell for it right so
again it all depends on how clearly you
read the document
again the biggest problem here is not
everybody reads the documentation
thoroughly we all read the documentation
to whatever depth we want to use it
right so again please don't use deadly
diamond type inheritances unless you
need it and if you see it any time when
you're working with a software engineer
if you see it just point it and say do
we really need it right not just in
Python in C++ Java wherever you go it's
a tricky case ok good so this was a good
lesson for me also because I have
forgotten how this works I get to be
honest with you I'm not perfect I forget
all these things I experiment I figure
it out right so but again if I were a
software engineer I can't effort to do
this as a machine learning engineer I
can say I missed this that's ok right
but if I was designing large software I
have to be much more careful with this
okay sounds good the next concept is
called polymorphism so ok let's go to
polymorphism enough again it's a very
standard technique in many programming
languages it's also very important in
the context of object Android
programming but before we go into
polymorphism what does this word mean
poly basically means many forms right
see polymorphism basically means many
forms are different forms for example
look at this when I just if I say 2 plus
3 okay
what does it written in Python it
returns 5 right look at this my plus is
an operator to which I'm passing two
integers here if I do the same thing
same operator look at this it is the
same operator but completely different
strings same operator completely
different strings what happens
it still concatenates and returns me
ABCDEF now which means which means the
plus operator is behaving differently
based on what I pass in different
contexts the plus operator is taking
different forms polymorphism basically
means many forms so the same plus
operator is taking is basically
performing numerical addition here the
same plus operator is doing string
concatenation here this is what is often
referred to as operator level
polymorphism it is the same operator but
behaving differently
the parameters that you have number one
then there is something called us
function level polymorphism okay take a
length function the length function that
we have in Python right I can pass
different things to it look at this I
can pass a dictionary I can pass a
string I can even pass a set here right
whatever I pass it will print the the
length of or the number of elements that
are there in that structure in the data
structure right string is also a data
structure or this is this is basically a
list whether I pass a list whether I
pass a string I think I said big - sorry
whether I pass a list whether I pass a
string or a set it will still print the
same thing so if you think about it the
length function also is performing
function level polymorphism which means
it is behaving differently it is
printing you see at the end of the day
it is printing the same thing but even
if I pass if whether I pass a list or a
string or asset class a no now look look
at what I am doing here this this is the
interesting part so I create a variable
a of type a variable B of class capital
B again lower case I'm using for
variable names upper case I'm using for
class names again this has function P
this has function P now here comes the
most interesting part this line is the
crux of it's one of the great ideas of
polymorphism in most programming
languages for example imagine I take a
and B I create a tuple out of it right
we know tuple is AI turrible we've seen
this in the previous life sessions we
wrote up please I trouble which means I
can first pick the first item then the
second item so on and so forth suppose
if I want to write a for loop like this
for I in a B again what is this this is
basically so I let me explain this
function right so let me explain this
two lines of code for I in a comma b
tuple print i dot p suppose I call this
how does this work
right so first what happens first I will
be equal to a look at this first I will
be equal to a because this is this is
basically I two doubles right I variable
I will will now will be equal to
then I will execute I dot P what is I
dot P is nothing but a dot P right so
what should what should execute it's s P
method
this one this one should execute nothing
right look at this the first in the
first iteration I equals to a then I'm
saying I dot P now what should this
execute this should execute this line
logically if you think about it next in
the second iteration I will be equal to
B now when I say I dot P what should
what should be executed it should be it
should this should execute B's P
function now what is happening if you
think internally internally if you think
what's happening is this your which
function is being executed whether this
function is being executed or this
function is being executed depends on
the the object type right the function
that runs or executes depends on the
object type so now again look at this a
is of is an object of type capital a B
is an object of type capital B right now
your I look at this what is happening in
the first iteration this is what is
happening in the second iteration this
is what is happening if you think
logically in both cases i dot p is it's
the same thing that is running but this
will go and run a dot P this will go and
run B dot P because it depends on object
type when you say I equals to a a is an
object of type capital a so SP will be
executed so polymorphism or class level
polymorphism right in in in Python
basically says the function that gets
executed depends on the object type
making the code much more easy to work
with for example imagine imagine if this
did not happen imagine if this did not
work like this imagine if we did not
have polymorphism then if I were to
write a complex loop like this again
here we have only two objects imagine
you have 100 objects of many different
types right somewhere suppose I have ten
classes and I have hundred objects from
these ten classes I will not be able to
write this for loop without wherein I
have objects of different class types
without having class level polymorphism
that that's an important catch for us
it's cool now now look at this now okay
so we have printed this so what what
happens here this for loop look at what
is printed first function P in a is
printed then function P in B is printed
okay so this loop runs twice and first
function P na then function P in be cool
then I have just put in a bunch of lines
here so as a separator now let's look at
a slightly different concept
okay whatever we have done here in an
iteration let's see it in a simple
expanded code snippet if I say x equals
to a now remember a is an object of type
capital a now when I say X dot P what
should execute a P should execute a SP
class SP function should execute that's
what it executes cool now the moment I
say X equals to B now now what happens X
is no more again when I say X equals to
B what happens B is an object of type
class B so X is not an object of Class B
right so when I say X dot B what will
execute B dot P will execute and that's
what you see here again what I've done
here is the code that is there in the
for loop I've just expanded it here for
clarity whether you do it like this or
whether you do it like this look at this
this line and this line are exactly the
same but you're getting two different
outputs because X is pointing to an
object of class a here X is pointing to
an object of Class B and based on the
based on the class of the object being
pointed the corresponding P function is
executed right cool now polymorphism and
inheritance can also be combined okay
let's go into it okay let me finish this
we have I traitors also right so okay so
let's see that there are a few examples
then I'll go to the questions from the
previous session I just wanted to finish
these in the next few minutes again
there are a few eggs again if required
we'll extend the session by 20 25
minutes if need be okay I hope we don't
need it but if you need we'll do it okay
sounds cool so okay polymorphism plus
inheritance right so let's go into it so
I have taken this is an example that we
saw yesterday right
we saw a class called shape
rectangle if you recall look at this we
have seen this rate we have a class
called shape we've seen this yesterday
we have a class called shape from shape
you get rectangle right from rectangle
from shape we also have circle we have
seen this example yesterday right so how
does polymorphism work in the case of it
in the case of inheritance in the
previous example there was no
inheritance so this example will use
both polymorphism plus inheritance in an
example because rectangle and circle are
a derived classes from shape right so
let's say let's see how this works okay
the same code snippet I haven't changed
much it's the same code snippet I just
wanted to change this this part changes
except that this code that that we have
seen yesterday is the same code that I'm
using now here comes the most
interesting part okay so let's go into
it so I have SS shape okay so I'm
creating a variable S lower case s of
class shape I am creating our of
rectangle C of circle now look at look
at the code that I am writing here for I
in s RC okay look at this again this is
a loop where I will first take s I will
be equal to s then I will be equal to R
then I will be equal to C now when I say
I dot get color
what should it print okay first it
prints s dot color the color function
that is there in the shape then the
colors the get color function which is
there in the rectangle because it all
depends on the object type but here is a
here is a very interesting case right so
for example okay first case is simple
okay I have s here I say so I equals to
s so let's write this down actually that
might be better
okay first first iteration I equals to s
so when I say I dot get color what
should get executed when I say I do not
get color what should get executed the
get color function that is there in
shape and that's simple okay so there is
a get color function where is this there
is a get color function it will the
default value of color is always black
it will print that cool so you get you
get this print statement that you want
right so you get this print state let me
just erase this this is okay so you get
the black it prints black so that that's
cool
second iteration okay in this in the
second iteration I will be equal to R
now when I say I dot get color what
happens so first thing that you have to
notice here is the get color is not
defined in rectangle look it is the in
the rectangle the get color is not
defined but rectangle inherits from
shape which means whatever is the get
color that is there in the shape is
inherited by rectangle so what happens
now when I say I dot get color what
happens now so it goes to a rectangle
okay this it goes to it goes to the
rectangle class sees if there is get
color there is no get color that I've
implemented here then it goes to its
parent its parent has a get color so
it'll actually this will basically
execute the get color in shape because
rectangle doesn't have it rectangle is
inheriting the get color function from
the shape in the third case I will be
equal to sorry I will be equal to circle
same thing circle also doesn't have get
color so when I say I don't get color
here when I say I don't get color what
happens wrong the circle also doesn't
have get color implemented but the get
color is inherited from shape so it will
go ahead and and execute the shapes get
color which means in all the three cases
the output will be black because the
shapes color is by default black in our
implementation right so if you look at
this the shapes default color is black
because the default parameter in the
constructor color takes black and you
are saying self underscore underscore
color equals to color it's a very simple
very simple code again this is how this
is how your polymorphism in the context
of inheritance works now there is an
other catch here okay so imagine if I
just say again this this is one more
example both are both rectangle both
rectangle and circle have implemented a
function called get area they have their
own functions they have their own
functions of get area okay so the shape
does not have get area right this is
derived from this this is derived from
this right
so now what happens if I say I equals to
R comma C I don't get area so I will
first be equal to R when I say get area
the rectangles get area will be printed
right so look at this I'm creating a
rectangle with length 10 with 20 so the
area is 200 which is printed here cool
very simple next when I say in the next
iteration I will be equal to C C dot get
area the circles get area will be called
the circle has a radius of 2 so if I
print the area I will get 12.5 cool so
this is how polymorphism plus
inheritance will work out okay so let's
let's go through some more examples okay
so oh this is this a very nice example
so let's look at polymorphism any
inheritance in the context of inbuilt
data structures remember all of the
inbuilt data structures even your int is
actually a class in Python we have shown
this yesterday right
so imagine imagine if I have D which is
a dictionary again D is nothing but it's
an object of type dictionary so it's an
object of class dictionary l is an
object of class list s is an object of
class set right and again we are
initializing them because these are
inbuilt data structures you don't have
to call dick you don't have to follow
the same notation that you do for other
classes there are some shortcuts because
there these are in Bill data structures
now comes the best part when I say for
int LS again all these three are inbuilt
data structures behind each of these
data structures there is a class so when
I say i equals to b LS remember that my
dictionary my list and my set all these
three classes would inherit directly or
indirectly from object because object is
directly or indirectly okay it could be
direct or indirect way I have not seen
the code behind how dicta list and set
is implemented in Python I've not I've
not seen it for this session but anyway
everything has to be derived from object
and let's not forget that I discussed
this yesterday right object has this
underscore underscore strength right
object has this function called
underscore underscore string which will
help us print the day print anything
that we want to
now with indict this is interesting part
the people who implemented the dick data
structure within Python have overwritten
this string I'm sure of it
they have overwritten the string again
that they're inheriting it from object
they have overwritten it similarly there
is a string implemented in list there is
a STR implemented in set also now the
implementation of STR or string indict
says okay whatever are the elements in
my dictionary I want you to print like
in this format curly braces right my key
key 1 value 1 comma key - value 2 so on
so forth braces closed so the underscore
underscore string underscore underscore
let's call it the string function right
the string function which is there an
object would have been overwritten with
indict and and this says if anybody
wants to convert any object for printing
purposes this is how it should print
this is defined within the bits internal
implementation I am sure of it 100%
right similarly within the lists
implementation there is this overridden
stuff and it says ok you should always
print all the elements that we have in
the list start with this braces print
each of my values value 1 value 2 so on
so forth with commas and all of this set
says print all of them with a curly
braces the value 1 value 2 so on so
forth curly braces so what's happening
enough ok this how these things are
internally implemented now when this
line is executed what happens first I
will be equal to D now when I say when I
say print D now so print I see look at
this in the first iteration I equals to
D right now what are we doing print I
print I basically means print the
dictionary again the way the print
function is implemented somebody asked
this in yesterday's live session also
somebody said ok how does the print know
that it should call underscore
underscore STR underscore underscore in
this that's how the print function is
implemented in Python right the print
function is implemented such that when
you pass any object to it if that object
if the class that this object belongs to
look at this so ok
take this example concretely right so I
equals to B so when I say printed a the
way print is implemented is it says okay
I is there what is the data type F of I
ice or what is the class of I I is an
object of type nicht so let's go and
check in bits implementation if
underscore underscore STR is that if it
is there let's call that whatever string
it returns I will print it that's how
the print is internally implemented so
when you actually execute this code when
you actually execute this code II's
initially be but what is happening here
is so this is this is calling mixed
dictionaries string function in the
second iteration I equals to L so when I
say print what is happening it is
calling lists underscore underscore STR
function in the third iteration I equals
to s and s is an object of type set or
class set right so it is going to call
sets string that's why this whole thing
looks so beautiful and works out of the
box but this is what is happening
internally there is polymorphism that is
happening internally there is
inheritance from the object class which
ensures that the string is available in
all these classes and the implementers
of dict list and set have overwritten it
again i wanted to show you a real
example of polymorphism inheritance by
using in Bill data structures because
these are extremely simple classes that
are already implemented in Python right
cool next is the concept of a terrible
objects or this is very interesting okay
so we all know what I tell a bill is
like we have discussed this in the
previous life sessions let me you do a
quick quick recap so when I do this
whenever I want to use something like
this in a for loop whenever I want to
say for I in something if I take a list
here list is I terrible
which means what happens here first I
will be given the first value then I
will take the second value then I will
take the third value then I will take
the fourth value in each of the
executions of this for loop so these are
called as a terrible objects okay your
topple is also a terrible we have seen
this in the previous examples right so
these are all terrible objects cool
simple now can I create okay this is
this the interesting part can I create
again remember that this is an object
let's not forget that basics this is an
object of class list it's an object of
class list so can I create classes so
the question here is this the question
here is this can I create classes whose
objects are also a terrible so I want to
create a terrible object I want to
create a class which I want to create a
class look at this I want to create a
class where the objects are I terrible
like a list or like a tuple can I do
that
or like a string for that matter shrink
is also a terrible we know that right so
can we do that that's the question right
so I terrible objects is a very
interesting concept it's there even in
the documentation in lots of detail so
if you go to this again this is not a
documentation this is just a tutorial so
I traitorous is a very interesting
concept so let me go through it okay
again there's a very very nice example
it's a beautiful example from Python
official tutorials I mean it's it's it's
a very real-world example look at this
imagine okay let's let's talk about the
real world problem then we'll come to
the solution so when I write like this
look at this this is my this is my list
when I write again remember that list is
an inbuilt class and which also
implements the inbuilt data structure
now whenever I write code like this it
first takes the first value then the
second value then the third value and
then the fourth value is it possible
that instead of going in this order if I
give a list
suppose if I write this if I write for I
equals two sorry for I in for I in 1 2 3
4 if I say if I say print I write so the
way the way list is implemented for I
iterators is first it takes the first
element second element third element
fourth element but I want it to be in
reverse order I will write it like this
first it should take 4 then it should
take 3 then it should take 2 then it
should take 1 so I want to reverse the
internal implement I want to reverse the
order in which
my I will take values the default is
this IFAs takes 1 then 2 then 3 then 4
but if I want to reverse it how do I do
it
cool so let's again this is a very nice
example from Python official tutorials
it's a beautiful example so here comes
the fun part again I've just copied this
code from Python official documentation
so the idea here is this let's create a
class called reverse ok let's create a
class called reverse ok I will explain
this class called reverse and we'll see
how we can make any object of this class
i turrible any object ok here comes the
fun part
first I am creating my constructor my
constructor look at this i have self and
data this data can be anything this data
again I am NOT saying the data has to be
list or anything look at what I am doing
with the data I am first creating a
variable within this class called data
self dot data equals to data self dot
index so in my reverse class in my
reverse class I have data and I have
index these are the two attributes that
I have let's say these are the
attributes right so these are the
attributes that I have of course I have
a constructor here and if you want to
make objects of a class I turrible
you have to implement ok this is very
important you have to implement both the
ITER and the next functions again this
is given in the documentation so if you
want to implement them where is this the
function bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
okay so for statements called ITER bla
bla bla okay sounds good so what you
have to do here is you have to implement
this function what are you doing here
again this is just underscore underscore
ITER there is one more very important
function that we had implement called
next the ITIL function it just takes the
object returns the object very simple
nothing fancy here ok but if you want to
make objects of any class like reverse
here I terrible you have to input this
is mandatory you have to implement this
and you have to implement this let's
look at the implementation of next again
remember that this data can be anything
the data can be a list it can be tuple
it can be strength
okay look look at how it's done it's
done very beautifully okay so enough in
that what does the ITER function
basically says if you give me an object
I just return the same object it's not
doing anything fancy the next is what is
doing okay I'll explain you how the next
let us understand the function then LLL
explain how the whole thing works you
just just be patient five minutes I'll
explain this okay the idea here is this
so it says because look at this I have
two attributes here right again I have I
have an init init function I have
basically and I have basically a
constructor I have basically this I
treasure this hydrated hydration
function I have the next function odd
method these are the three methods that
I have these are the three methods that
I have now let's see let's see how this
let's understand the implementation what
this is saying this is saying if the
index value equals to zero again in the
in the suppose let's just take this
right suppose in this data
suppose I pass one two three four let's
understand this okay so look at this if
I say R equals two rivers I'm creating
an object of type reverse class and what
am i passing here one two three four so
what is this this is nothing but the
data that you are passing right so in
the data in the data what happens you
get one two three four right and what is
the index being initialized to in the
constructor index is nothing but length
of data what is the length of this
length will be equal to four because
there are four elements here till of
everything is cool now comes the fun
part
okay I'll explain you how the next works
now when it says for I in are look at
this for I in our what is our R is
nothing but it's an object of type
rivers internally look at this
internally it is storing this this
dictionary this are not dictionaries at
this list right this list of one two
three four is being stored internally
within this class rivers in an attribute
called data okay it's been stored
internally now we're sorry okay so let
me just erase this part so that I can
explain this just give me a second I'll
erase this part so that it's easier to
just scroll up okay so okay
so enough enough look at this so when I
say for I equals to R now what should
happen here this basically says that we
want to iterate this right
so this ITER right this underscore
writer writer basically makes this
object I terrible to start with so R is
an object of class reverse and every
object of class reverse is a terrible
now because of the presence of this
underscore underscore ITER right because
it is lighter able there is no error in
this line right because it is I terrible
there is no error in this line next look
at this when I in are I don't want to
rewrite the same line but anyway I will
explain this so when I say print I look
at how this loop executes this is where
the next function plays an important
role so watch what will happen here
first I for I in our we don't know how
our works internally okay because there
is this underscore underscore ITER it
makes any object of class reverse I
terrible that we know next what is the
first value that I should take nuf look
at this this this variable I has to take
some value of the values that are stored
in our what value does it take for that
you have to go to next
so whenever whenever we run this line
for I in our whenever we want to so this
will run multiple times right this is
basically an iteration right
it will run multiple times whenever the
value of I has to be initialized to some
value based on the object are as soon as
we want to do this I equals to what to
determine this python goes to the
underscore underscore next so the
underscore underscore next function
basically tells us in an eye traitor
give me the next value that I want
that's why it is called the next
function now how is the next function
implemented it says if the index value
equals to zero then raise an exception
there is an error that's right will
raise an exception otherwise again index
value is not equals to 0 it is equal to
4 now so it says okay there is no error
now so we don't have to raise an
exception or an error self dot index
equals to self dot index minus 1 which
means this in
value will become three again this is
all object ours data every object has
this data right this is all object ours
lowercase ours data so index becomes
three then it says return self dot data
self index so what is self dot data self
dot data is this index is 3 so what what
will return it would return data 3 what
is data 3 it is value 4 so now this next
function see whenever I has to be given
a value it will call the underscore
underscore next function now why does it
call the underscore underscore next
function because that's how Python
language defined it there are some rules
of a language so the Python language
said whenever we want to iterate
whenever I want to initialize this
variable to one of these to some value
from an I terrible object I will call
the next function whatever the next
function returns I will place it here
the next function returned for here
right it returned this value right then
it is say print for so what do you get
you get print 4 enough this is over now
as soon as I have printed this is for
loop right in the second iteration again
I says I want to value so I goes to
object are and says give me a value now
python rules say okay
r is an eye trouble object so we have to
go and call the next function now how
does the next function what next
function checks is the index 0 no the
index is not 0 if it is 0 will raise an
exception or else decrement the index
the index becomes tune of right and
return the value in data 2 so it will
return 3 look at this look I becomes 3
in the next iteration I becomes 2 in the
next iteration I becomes 1 cool right so
you can make any object I turrible by
just defining this function this
function says that any object is
iterable any object of class reverses i
turnable this function says whenever i
whenever i have a line like this and
whenever i want to pick a equals to give
me a value in whenever this line is
executed INR okay I says okay give me a
value I goes to
and says please give me a value from
your from your whatever you're storing
internally I don't care how you're
storing it so then we go into our Python
internally does this for us it goes into
the next function whatever the next
function returns it will place it here
so the way we have written the logic for
the next function is as if we are
iterating backwards
we are not iterating forwards we are I
trading backwards the beauty of this
implementation is whether we pass list
here if you pass a list it will work but
we have not used anything specific to
lists here right this could have been a
string and it will work this could have
been a couple and it will work right
because all the functions that we've
used the index all the functions all the
methodologies that we have used C it
will even work for if I pass instead of
instead of passing a dictionary if I
pass a triple like this it will simply
work because for a couple again remember
oh there is there's okay even for string
it will work okay so let me show you
multiple cases okay good
let me show you where it will work and
where it will not work so if my data
that I pass into the constructor is a is
a is a list it will work because live
list is indexable I just need the index
right here again what am i doing
given the data I am indexing it and I am
getting the length of the data these are
the only two places where the data's
functions where I am using where I am
performing some operation on the data
right here I'm indexing it in this line
I'm indexing it sorry in this line I am
indexing it in this line I am getting
the length so wherever the length
function works and wherever I can index
I can use the data structure right on a
list I can do it so it will work right
on on a tuple I can index right I can
also get the length so it will work on a
string it'll work look at this if you
want to reverse a string this is the
object-oriented way with iterators to do
it right but it will not work on sets
why doesn't it work on sets okay simple
look at this it doesn't work on sets
because where does it run into an error
it will run into an error in this line
because lengths on a set is okay you can
say lengths and you can give a set right
you can give a set and it will work the
length function will work but a set is
not indexable and it says this set
object
is not subscrip double which means you
can't index into it so that's why it
will not work again here what are we
doing here
we are creating a class whose objects
are I terrible right and this class I
can pass in the constructor I can either
pass a list I can pass it to pull I can
pass a string anything that is indexable
and anything on which I can on which I
can call the length function that's the
idea here okay sounds good so now let's
go into a few questions from yesterday's
live session okay sounds good okay so
are there any questions here which are
important there is slight buffering I
don't see any hiccup from my side I had
a small interruption I think it's full
speed enough thankfully yeah sounds good
okay somebody says please teach ml again
please understand that the objective of
these live sessions is to improve the
programming skills and not specifically
machine learning so we will cover
machine learning and again we'll cover
machine learning from a programmatic
standpoint later right so the objective
here is not to teach machine learning I
think I've mentioned this earlier in the
announcements also somebody says can we
apply recursion in class you can you
have to be careful but you can apply
recursion in classes again try it like
it's very simple very importantly
somebody again let me go back to this
question somebody's asking please teach
machine learning I think we made it very
clear at the very beginning when we
announced these live sessions that the
objective of these live sessions is to
improve programming skills of the
students right I think I taught a bit of
numerical programming also again in the
context of machine learning applications
without doubt right so I hope there is
yeah now I'm streaming it like 6 Mbps
enough I hope there should not be any
cups nuf sounds good now let's go into
some of the questions from yesterday's
live chat window ok somebody said what
is the use of empty classes ok these are
the questions one-by-one I'll tackle
them there are some concepts also that
I'll introduce as we go ok
first and foremost somebody said what is
the use of empty classes
I mentioned in yesterday's session
itself it can be used as a structure in
C programming now those of you who don't
know structures in C programming here is
an example that I've made okay so let's
say I have Class E okay there is nothing
it's an empty class so here if you
notice what I've done here is I've
created a variable E one of class type e
again remember E is empty plus E is an
empty class let us not forget that class
E is an empty class cool now I can
create any variable name or attribute
name that I want and give values to it
so I can say e 1 equals to e ok so this
is an empty class class e does not have
any attributes does not have any methods
but because it is an empty class I can
use it as a structure in C programming
language right so one of the
applications of structures is this
suppose I created I create a one-way
variable of class E I can create any
attribute name that I want I can say e 1
dot name is ABC e 1 dot number is 1 2 3
and if I print even dot name and e 1 dot
number it will print ABC one two three
right so I've created an object of e1 I
have added whatever attributes that I
want for this object because the class
itself is empty I can do this the class
is not empty I can't do it number one
number two I create another object of
type a of class a basically class E I
could add an object a two now here II 1
has look at this
II won has name and number these are the
two attributes that I have object II 1
not class II object even object e 2 I
can have the same attributes or I can
have any other attribute I can have name
and address if I want right so an empty
one of the applications of empty classes
is I can just use it like a like a box
right you can think of this like this e
is a box in which I'm holding these two
variables together e 2 is like a box or
a container in which I'm storing these
two values now if I want to print these
values I can say e 2 dot name e 2 dot
address even dot name a 1 not number I
can do that that's one application the
other application that I just discussed
a while ago is if
want to inherent so we have done this we
have written this code right if I want
to inherit it from both classes a and B
but I don't want to implement anything
here again I have a bad habit of putting
semicolons it's not mandatory in Python
but since I come from C C++ and Java
world I do put in these in place right
so what do what do we do enough I just
say Class E a B now what does class II
have everything that is there in a and B
is inherited into E I don't want to
override anything here I want all the
stuff that is there in a and B to be
inherited without overriding or without
implementing anything extra if I want to
do that in empty class like this with
inherited with with base classes from
which I'm inheriting is one application
so it's a very simple so next somebody
asked or this is a good question
actually somebody asked can we create a
function with it in the init constructor
again for any question the easiest way
that I know of again it's always great
if you can read documentation but
documentation can become very cumbersome
so whenever I get a question I just
write like simple code like this and see
how it works
okay and then try to understand why it
is working like that if I can understand
or else I will read the documentation so
somebody asked in yesterday's live
session I think there is also comment
like this which I responded today in the
morning
within the init function look at this in
Python functions you can define an
another function so in the init function
because in it is a special function
right it is a constructor can we have an
another function within in it that's a
question that somebody asked in the
comment section in the live session
yesterday so let's look at this I have
class a def this is my this is my
constructor within the constructor I
have an another function look at this
this is a function definition I am
defining a function called as function
within which is there within the init
function this is valid you can define a
function in an another function in
Python in it is not no special you can
do that even on an init because if you
just write it it works another very nice
thing that somebody suggested it's a
very useful thing that I missed earlier
which is there is this inbuilt function
called dinner okay very nice function
actually
what bill does is this okay bill can
help us obtain all the attributes and
methods in a class right in a module or
in dictionaries in lists etc for example
let's just write this right input math
remember math is a module right I mean
you can think of math as a library or a
module that you're importing right so
print dillmouth when I say dear math
what it prints is it prints all the
functions that I have in math see in
math if you recall you have square root
function that we have used earlier you
have a constant PI you have math dot na
n that we have used in our initial life
sessions you can compute log base 2
right you can compute cosine all right
these you can compare you can compute
sine right you can get radians all these
stuff so these are all the functions
that are there in the math module that
you can use so at any point if you are
not sure of course one way is to go and
read the documentation the other way if
you don't want to go through the whole
documentation just print it if you want
to know that's the simplest way next
this can again that there is a very
useful here we are applying dill on a
module now what happens if I apply bill
on a class so let's define a simple
class here very simple example again
dill can be extremely useful to see
what's happening internally ok I wanted
to cover
ok let's go to it ok let's go step by
step suppose if I say Class B within
class B I have function f that I've
defined M I'm saying print will be when
I say it didn't be all the functions and
attributes that are there especially the
functions that are there in B will be
printed now F is a user-defined function
I have defined this function the
programmer defined it so you'll see F
here listed clearly F is printed here
but along with F there are many other
functions because B is inheriting from
the object class let us not forget that
because there is no inheritance here the
default inheritance is from object so
all the functions that are there in the
object are also printed here ok this
there is a default constructor that I
told you yesterday about there is STR
function that I told you yesterday about
there is also a new function
discussed about these three functions
yesterday knew basically creates a
variable in it is the constructor string
basically helps you print the objects I
discussed these three yesterday right so
dinner is a very useful thing at any
point for any class if you are not sure
what it should be just go and say it
there you'll get all the functions that
are there in that class very easily okay
in many so in this case let's see so if
I if I want to know what is there in
math right in math so in in in ipython
especially if a type dot and if I type
tab so I just perhaps typed tab okay
those of you can't here look at this
math dot I don't know what is that what
what is to be there so if I just type
tab it will autofill it will give me all
these values again this is very specific
to ipython and jupiter notebooks so i
can go here and they say what is pi okay
there is pi here okay and i can i can
just execute it and it will print pi
again this is called as autofill or
smart fill there are more there are much
better integrated development
environments that also tell you
given a function it will tell you what
are all the parameters in that function
so there are better and more complex
ideas for Python the reason we use
ipython is because it's it's much more
widely used in the machine learning
community to see how things are working
step by step
right so ipython or Jupiter is something
that is very popular in the machine
learning community and that's why we are
using here but if you are using a
different ide for python it will have
autofill smart fill smart suggest all of
those things okay so somebody asked this
question okay so we talked about private
attributes yesterday the question here
is how do private methods work do they
work very similar to private attributes
yes they work exactly like private
attributes let's take an example so I
create a class see look at this I create
a class see again please understand that
I am using Python okay okay I should
have said okay sorry there is a small
typo here but that's okay not a major
issue so Class C right so if you notice
anything which has two underscores again
this is a convention
these are all conventions these are not
rules of the programming language when I
say again rules are something there two
differences anything that is a rule of
the programming language you have to
follow it otherwise it will go crazy
conventions like this like double
underscore if you have this this is a
convention that all the programmers
agreed upon but how it behaves depends
on the implementation of the Python
interpreter if you are into again we are
using a Python interpreter to execute
this code right it depends on the Python
interpreters implementation so the
convention says again when I say rule it
has to be strictly followed convention
is something that everybody has worked
on but its behavior depends on the
Python interpreter okay there are two
different things so yesterday we saw
that by convention if you have two
underscores this will behave like a
private member right again
there could be some Python interpreters
which will get which will not throw an
error there are some Python interpreters
that will throw an error the one that
I'm using now throws an error what am i
using now I'm using the default one that
I get in my okay where is it okay I
didn't run it okay so let me just run it
anyway I think I'm using version three
if I'm not wrong but let me just check
just give me a second insert cell above
imports this print sister question I
think I'm sorry
so again system basically is a module
which has a bunch of interesting
functionality yes so I'm using three
point seven point three and I'm using
the the interpreter built in C version
number ten point zero point one all of
that stuff cool so in this in this again
remember that having two underscores
makes a member whether it's an attribute
or a method does not matter here this is
a method yesterday we saw private
attributes this is a private method so
now let's see what happens
so this private method is called within
the class okay I'm so I have class C let
me explain this code snippet quickly
right so I have class C which has a
function which is underscore underscore
PR which is a private method
a private function and I have PU because
there is no underscores before this I
treat it as public by convention this is
not a rule it's a convention that's a
subtle difference that's important so
within PU I am calling this function
okay again there should be ok right
because it's in the same class a private
member should be accessible within the
pub with within the other members of the
same class it's not accessible from
outside ok so now let's see so I said
seeing equals to this
ok I'm creating a variable called lower
case C of Class C I say C dot pu4 okay I
think there is a small error in the code
but let me just execute it yeah so the
error was slightly off but anyway so now
what happens I created this I execute
this now what does it do again remember
that there are no underscores here so
it's a public method so it will go it
will pass for here x equals to 4 now
within this I am calling the private
method so what is it cut saying self dot
I again with from within this public
function I can call the private function
nothing stops me from doing it right so
I passed to power 4 is 16 plus 1 I
returned 17 17 is being printed no
worries enough when I when I call this
remember the convention says if you have
double underscore it's a private so if I
if I try to call this private method
from outside right look at this I'm
trying to call this from outside the
class from within the class there is no
problem when I call it from outside the
class what happens look at this it says
has no C object has no attribute
underscore underscore PR so it says it
has no object at all to start with so
now one thing that you can do here so
you've just run this right you can use
dar here to help you so if you say print
dir see yeah
print dar see yes the syntax is right
look at this so print D arcy what should
it do it will print all the functions
that are there in this class see now if
you notice like all these so look at
this you
pee-yew here you have your PU here the
public function you also have your PR
but PR is not as PR PR is done
represented using this look at this the
again the others are all being basically
see the Class C is is is deriving from
object that's where you get all these
other other functions but the PR
function is not there s PR function it
is there as underscore C underscore
underscore PR again this is a hack that
Python does internally just to cover up
its private its private variables or
private class members okay this is
something there is there is a so okay so
this is often called as name mangling so
in the documentation that I shared
yesterday also
so private instance members right
whether it is a whether it's a variable
or a function doesn't matter so what it
does is it internally represents this
using this concept called as name
mangling which may again that is for
internal for internal details again if
you want to learn that you have to learn
the internals of how Python stores all
these things internally right so when
you're when you write DRC you see the PU
which means you can it's a public
function so you should be able to call
it but the PR is not available PR is
represented like this which means it's a
private function which you cannot come
so given any class if you want to know
which are private and which are public
the simplest way is to print this
anything that you see in the simple form
like this at the end they are all public
this is private again both private and
public the Tuda the double underscore is
a convention let's not forget that the
double underscore is a convention right
some interpreters respect this some
interpreters do not the interpreter that
I am using which is the interpreter in C
language version 10.04 one or this whole
thing this is following this convention
it's not a rule it's a convention okay
sounds good now okay next comes some
somebody has a very good question
yesterday again right so so okay sorry
okay so there is no problem with speed
right I just want
to ensure that before I continue okay
okay
Oh somebody's asking can we call okay
that's a good good question can we call
it using this so let's try it I don't
think you can call it but let's try it
again
I'm not annex internals expert but let's
try it why not
insert cell below again I think that
will be slightly
implementation-dependent
but let's try it right seedot so we have
variable C right we have variable C what
did we call here we called okay we call
this so instead of calling this so what
you're suggesting here is let's call
this with C underscore underscore C is
that what it is
underscore C underscore underscore pr4
oh it worked yes so it worked so
somebody asked this question it's a good
question so can we access the private
variable from outside using this syntax
again that is implementation specific at
least the interpreter that I am using is
letting me do that because again
remember the whole concept of private
methods is a convention it is left to
the interpreter and programmers to
figure it out
so within within again if I call again
this is a question that somebody asked a
very good question I just bumped into it
right so again in some interpreters this
might work in some interpreters it may
not work in this interpreter it's
working just wanted to make that clear
right again any doubt you have just
write five lines of code and you will be
able to figure it out that's what I do
very often because I don't remember the
internals of Python programming so well
that I just try it I just say okay I
don't know let's figure it out in five
minutes what is that it's not rocket
science again from him from if I were a
software engineer designing production
quality C code I should be knowing much
more internal depth than this obviously
but as a machine-learning guy because
I'm not going to go into internals as
much it doesn't really matter okay so
yesterday somebody asked this question I
think they wore a C or C as the never
C++ programmer so just like public and
private in C++ there is this concept
called as protected so again
blick private and protected are keywords
in Python in C++ so somebody asks do we
have productive members in in in Python
ok again remember that in Python
everything is public by default it is
only convention that if you put two
underscores it will make it private and
if you want protected and I'll tell you
what is protected with an example
protected one underscore makes it
protected now let me show you what
protected basically means okay so the
definition of protected in C++ in C++
the production the the definition of
protected is this this variable whether
it's a whether it's a function or
whether it's a it's an attribute it is
accessible in all subclasses but not
from outside the class that's a
definition in C++ right that's a
definition in C++ so let's modify the
code that we wrote a while ago and what
I'll explain you with examples right
cool so now what do we have okay so
double underscore double underscore
basically it is private do two two
underscores again it is implementation
dependent and it is a convention
suggested right so you have private and
you have public cool both of them are
cool now if you inherit it look at this
so this is private this is public right
so this is where things get very
interesting I'll introduce you to
protected with a small example so I have
C here let me use a different color I
have class C here and I have Class D
there is try again remember that private
and protected our only implementation
specific conventions not part of python
programming i can't reinforce eyes this
in python by default everything is
public it is just implementation okay I
can write a Python interpreter where I
don't give a damn about double
underscores or single under underscores
so it's left it's a convention that is
used ok so now come back let's let's
come back here you have double
underscore PR and you have P you right
now now let's let's let's go end ok so I
have class D which inherits from Class C
so within Class D I have function f1 f2
cool all this is good now let's do a
couple of very interesting things first
I would say print D arcy
I want to see what all stuff are there
see in see if you notice we have seen
this earlier right your private function
is there as a underscore C underscore
underscore PR your public function is
there as public itself cool that we have
understood what about B so I create an
object of type D and I say print did D
now in DD what do you have this is
interesting in D will be look at this in
B look at this in D what all functions
do I have defined F 1 F 2 so I have F 1
F 2 because I have defined it in the
definition of D and D is also inheriting
remember the D is inheriting from C
which means everything that is there in
C will come here so if you notice
carefully you get P you here you get P
you here right you get PR also here so
when I say dildey I get this also right
and if I say print D dot again one more
interesting thing suppose if I have this
okay so very interestingly one more case
okay so my D has whatever is there in my
C is coming into my D along with it I
have two more functions F 1 F 2 now here
comes the interesting part now if I call
print D dot F 2 with 4 as the variable
then what happens
let's see what happens I pass my 4 here
I think I think I have to execute this
there is a small error somewhere in the
code let me also execute this ok fine
cool I wrote to power I instead of to
start star eyerly err I was doing some
other notation mad my bad
anyway so the moment I call this look at
let's see what happens here I go to F 2
F 2 is being executed with I equals to 4
then what is f 2 calling internally it
is calling tu now where is PU there PU
is there in Class C right remember she
has Class C has PR and PU from this I I
have D D has F 1 and F 2 I always draw
diagrams like this so that it's easier
for me right so I call d dot F to for
could be has F 2 I go to F 2 and of F 2
internally calls PU it can call PU
because PU is a public function right so
it will it can call it work perfectly
no issues now comes a funny part okay
now instead of that now let's look at
this look at imagine if I call it D dot
F 1 d dot F 1 and if I pass for what
happens enough okay suppose if I say
print if I write this line print D dot
f1 for if I'm not written it that's
there in the next next thing but I want
to show with the code if I run this what
happens first D has F 1 so I go to F 1
there is one parameter this parameter
value will be for now I am saying self
dot underscore underscore PR look at
this I'm saying underscore underscore PR
but then PR is a private member of C PR
is a private member of C now now the
question here is again in this
implementation in this implementation of
the interpreter can I access PR what am
I doing here if you think about it from
a subclass D is a subclass let's not
forget that from a subclass C is a some
laser subclass C is a parent class this
is this is the cont
this is one of the terminology is also
used in C++ C++ Volvo was one of the
first optional programming like was all
the first objective programming
languages so a lot of terminology came
from there so not what happens look anis
I am calling a private function in the
parent class from a subclass this
implementation gives an elephant so this
implementation says if you have a
private class in the parent class you
cut you can only access it in this class
you can only access this function in
this class any private member whether it
is an attribute or a method you can't
access it even in your subclasses so
when I execute again remember in this
Sigma this is all implementation
specific unfortunately okay so a private
variable again in C++ also a private
variable or a private function you
cannot access it in subclasses right
cool this is simple right well now let's
see let's see when I execute this line
when execute this line let's see what
error I get I know how to fix it also
enough so if I say D dot f1 for you just
say
the object has no attribute underscore D
underscore underscore PR and what does
this mean look at this what does it say
it says I don't know D underscore
underscore PR I don't know how to run
this look at this it says I don't know
how to run this I just can't run it
because in D when I when I inherited it
D from C look at this when I inherited D
from C the private function was not
inherited but here comes the interesting
part but if I want to call this if I
want to call this is there a way around
in this interpreter in this
implementation of the Python interpreter
there is a way around because the moment
I said print B a or D what did I get
where is the pure function the pure
function is called underscore CPR this
is what I have now right so if I just
change my implementation so if I just
change my implement instead of calling
self dot this if I say self dot C dot
double underscore PR because in my in my
class D when I said better be I have
this no I have this so if I do this I'm
assuming that in this implementation it
should work let's try it let's try it
okay no error so I'm calling h1 for now
let's see if this works
yes it works look at how I've changed my
code earlier what did I have earlier I
just had
again this is implementation specific I
am repeating it multiple times earlier
what did I have I just had self dot
underscore underscore PR I that did not
work right because of the name mangling
thing that Python is doing but instead
of calling it like that if I just call
it using this name it was working how do
I know I have to call this name again I
somebody just asked a few minutes back I
just tried that a while ago I tried this
here right it was working because it is
working in this implementation of Python
I said when I do print drd I'm seeing
this function here which means I should
be able to call that function what stops
me from calling that function nothing so
I just call that function it is working
right again this is a confusing part
whenever you are using a Python
interpreter you be very careful to check
for all these cases because
implementation-specific but name
mangling is something that is done in at
least in the official interpreter that
is given by by python dot over G this is
how it's implemented because to the best
of my knowledge I am using the official
Python interpreter okay sounds good now
okay all this is good now what if what
if what if I want slightly different
stuff okay there is this concept called
protected right the way protected works
in C is also in C++ is this so if I have
a Class C if I have class B again we
represent protected by convention using
a single underscore private by two
underscores public no underscore that's
that's that's the that's the convention
in Python right suppose if I declare
suppose if i declare a function like
this let's say i say PR or protect PR or
let us call it protected right let's
call it protected here now if i if d
inherits from c right so what is
protected
technically in c++ predicted is
accessible in all subclasses so in this
subclass i should be able to access
protected but i should not be able to
access it outside the class but here in
this implementation what happens here is
okay let me show you the code so that it
becomes clearer in this implementation I
can access it okay let's go through so
protected in Python is one underscore
public this underscore this is to
underscore remember convention and not a
feature of the programming language it
is implementation dependent again you
can read the documentation here now
let's see okay let's let's see slightly
modified version of this I have class C
again here single underscore so it is
protected by convention protected due to
one underscore again it is convention
implementation dependent I just always
mentioned that then I have C so what do
I have now let's write down the
structure here I have C which has
underscore P R and P you and I have B
which has F 1 and F 2
now within F 1 look at this in F 1
I'm using the protected method and I
should be able to use it right I mean
it's a protected method right
technically I should be able to use it I
have a public method public anyway I can
use
but to be very clear let's actually
print the beers again deers are useful
if I just say DRC look at this this is
very interesting if I say DRC and print
it look at what all i get i get my pu
but I get my PR my underscore PR I don't
get name mangling look at this name
mangling is not happening name mangling
is not happening if you remember if I
put double underscore if I made it a
private variable the name mangling was
happening like this right earlier we saw
this C double underscore PR this was
what was happening for private right for
for protected when I just do one
underscore nothing is happening no name
mangling is happening for protected
because in this official implementation
of Python they actually don't care about
protected well if you want protected in
the programming language you can use the
convention here this single underscore
PR is just being treated like a public
method I'll show you how in this
implementation again I am using the
official si Lang interpreter that is
given by Python Otemachi right so the
single underscore PR look at this so
okay this is where I run it look at this
it so when I run okay let us look at
this code right D f-14 okay so I'm
calling f1 right so I'm passing for this
is calling underscore PR no errors it is
giving me an answer no error see if I
even execute this it gives me an answer
comfortably it gives me an answer of 60
no errors but now here comes another
question remember this is single
underscore earlier for private methods
we could not call it from outside the
class look at this I have Class C in
Class C by convention this is protected
and this is public right in in Python in
this implementation of Python in this
interpreter if I say C equals to C I can
call the protected method from outside
the class so the protected method right
protected method is just behaving like a
public method in this Python in Python
3.7 using the si Lang interpreter
in C++ it behaves slightly differently
those of you who know C++ so in protect
so the way protected works in C++ is it
works like a private variable which
means you can't call it like this you
could this won't work in C++ but you can
access it in subclasses right so the
whole reason in having protected
sometimes is those people designers
those those algorithm designers who
designed earlier in C++ who want to
follow the same convention of public
protected and private they can just
follow this convention and say double
underscore basically means private
single underscore is public and you have
sorry single underscore is protected
single underscore is protected no
underscore is public but this is just a
convention the Python 3.7 si Lang
interpreter is respecting private it is
not respecting the protected definition
as in C++ I just wanted to make that
clear another question that came up
yesterday was constructor overloading
again this is a way this is somebody
probably who wrote C or C++ code sorry
not C code so again it doesn't work in
Python let me show you an example what
is overloading suppose if I have Class A
I am defining two constructors look at
this this is one constructor I am again
defining the same constructor there is a
difference this this constructor is only
taking one variable this constructor is
taking two variables which means this
constructor is different from this
constructor cool so this is what is
called as constructor overloading in C++
right again this is possible in C++ in
Python what happens is this if I just
say a1 equals to a10 look at this I'm
just passing one parameter if this was
C++ it would actually call this function
and it would execute without any errors
Python says sorry I am NOT doing any
overloading whichever is the function
that is defined later so it says you
have defined seats it doesn't give an
error here for this snippet of code it
doesn't give an error it gives an error
here it gives an error for this line
so what Python says is okay you have an
init function you are doing one more
same function with a different set of
parameters so whatever is defined later
I will take this I will simply ignore
this so now if you pass only one
parameter this will say hey I don't have
anything which is one parameter so it
will it will throw an error so what it
throws is this look at this it says
again where is the error error is in
this line it says in it missing one
positional argument J so what it's
saying here is the unit that I know is
this because again remember this is
there and this is there so whatever is
the later definition it keeps that the
uglier definition it will completely
remove it we'll get rid of it right
again this is one form of constructor
overloading this is one form of it all
right so now in this case it will only
take the mode the later definition and
it will make it work cool so that's that
was one of the questions another
question also on the other hand if I
don't use this one parameter if I just
give two parameters if I just give two
parameters there is no problem right it
will take because this is the valid one
or this is the active one
this got overwritten here this got
overwritten only this exists you don't
have this you know it's other
programming languages this will work
without an error this will also work in
another but not in Python now another
question can we call other functions
within in it okay this was a question
that was asked okay look at this
can we call another function within it
why should we not be able to call it
okay let's see let's see but let's be
sure let's just write simple snippet of
code so my in it has two parameters I J
I am calling another function called F
cool there should be no problem here and
I am calling this function f cool I mean
what is the problem here everything
should work right but the moment I
execute this I start seeing an error I
say okay suppose I go through this I
said I read name f is not defined why
the heck name F is not different I have
defined my function here right what is
wrong with Python why is it misbehaving
look at this very simple code here very
simple code here right again look at
this
constructor I'm calling an another
function in the same class nothing
nothing crazy same plus I'm calling
another function they should work right
the problem here again a very common
mistake is not using self you should say
self dot then it will work look at this
again it's a very common mistake that
people do is missing out self when you
are writing your own classes please
don't miss out self self is extremely
important because here it didn't
understand what F is the moment you
change it and say self dot F which means
in this object there is a function
called F call that function the moment
you do this everything will work right
that's it that's the only error now
again so I think yeah we have 10 more
minutes so these are some of the
questions that I saw from yesterday's
session with it which I thought we'll
cover again anywhere is plan to planning
to cover protected methods today but
thankfully somebody asked that question
and we got it away again the most
important thing is again if you've
worked for years on Python and if your
world as a software development engineer
you are expected to know the internals
fairly well right if you have especially
worked as a software development
engineer for a few years for machine
learning folks the internals of
object-oriented programming
object-oriented design if you know some
internals it will help you but at any
point if you are not sure of the
internals this is what I do I do not
consider myself as a very good Python
programmer because I have seen people
who know the internals like crazy inside
out in my own team
phenomenal senior software engineers I
don't consider myself to be an expert at
Python internals I know a few of them
not not all of them and if I don't
revise I forget very common right and as
a machine learning guy I mostly use lot
of a lot of others libraries and things
like that so I seldom implement classes
and objects of my own unless I have to
extend an existing class so as to help
my software engineers build it right so
the amount of object-oriented
programming that I have written is less
than 10 percent of my total programs
that I've ever written all that in
almost 10 plus
right as a machine-learning engineer
machine learning scientist all of that
right I think I've written less than 10%
of my code probably when less than 5% of
my code okay to in object loaded using
object like I have used object hundred
programming because I use classes I use
objects I use all of that but I have not
written core object-oriented programming
with multiple inheritance wherein I have
to know all the internals etc for a
software development engineer they spend
almost 70 plus percentage of their time
writing classes doing object-oriented
design hence they know the internals
much better right so everybody has this
consent so at any point my general
suggestion is this if you don't know how
the internals work simple just write a
simple snippet of code figure it out if
you are not sure just read up about it
and write a snippet of code right so
just one more point in later sections
will use major libraries again in later
sections but if you're if you're a
course participant in the course we use
lots of libraries also in the future
live sessions that we are planned to
conduct in this series we use a lot of
major libraries either for plotting like
matplotlib scikit-learn
the tons of libraries we use again in
those instances we will revisit some of
these object hundred programming
concepts because in there I can actually
show you the practical aspects in lot
more depth right now I can't take you to
scikit-learn and and overwrite let's say
logistic regression because you don't
know what scikit-learn does you don't
know what logistic regression does at
least I did not expect that to be a
prerequisite for this session right
that's why I'm not covering it but as we
progress in this series I'll surely
cover more object I will revisit again
and again the object under concepts when
we look at other machine learning data
signs and plotting libraries number one
number two as an as I exercise what
we'll do later is we will extend some
inbuilt classes like I told you right in
scikit-learn there is this class called
logistic regression right so we will
extend some mush somebody asked this
question in yesterday's live session but
I
thought it is not right to implement
here because there are participants here
who may not know how scikit-learn
logistic regression works internally
right how what what even logistic
regression does or what scikit-learn
does because I did not mention that as a
prerequisite so later on as we progress
in this series I will extend the
logistic regression specific I'll extend
some of these logistic regression I will
extend the logistic regression class and
will modify some of these classes to
suit our needs but that will do later
after we cover a bunch of libraries for
machine learning data science plotting
statistics deep learning etcetera we'll
do it in a very contextual manner so
that you are connecting the concepts to
real-world stuff instead of just
learning it again remember all these
that I explained here if you don't
connect it to practical stuff will
forget it in no time
I've forgotten some of this to be honest
with you I have not used multiple
inheritance are not I don't recall
diamond diamond inheritance I know what
it is I've never used it so I don't know
how Python behaves in that situation
right it's very common to forget it so
it's okay just revise these concepts as
and when you need better still whenever
I am in doubt I just write code right so
that's my suggestion here somebody says
are can you tell about operator
overloading I will do that later because
overloading is operator overloading is a
slightly different concept we'll
probably do it at a later time right
sounds good so any any general questions
we have like ten more minutes so any
general questions you have I would
happily take some of these and again
we'll announce the next next bunch of
live sessions on YouTube little later we
are just still planning what we should
cover after this oh good somebody says a
very good form see you say I feel like
cheating when using a method or class
directly without actually knowing the
know-how of it example numpy or any
other particular research we do what is
there so the problem here is this one
c2b ought to be fair to be honest with
you it's very hard to know everything
because my question to you is this okay
suppose we are using nd array okay to
represent an end
numpy and we have used it in the
previous life sessions you can go one
step below right you can go one step
deeper and say hey I want to understand
how ndr is implemented I touched upon it
in the previous life session right it is
implemented just as a block of memory in
and this is all implemented in C C++
right this is basically a block of
memory that is used now you can see you
can go one level deeper you can say hey
how is this block of memory how does C
program allocates this block of memory
okay then you have to know concepts in
operating systems called virtual memory
right then you have to go into the core
of operating system kernel itself then
you have to go into the hardware itself
so where do you stop again an
undergraduate computer science student
learns many of these things again you
learn about virtual memory and operating
systems in operating systems course you
learn about you learn about hardware in
computer organization and architecture
right again the high-level details to be
honest with you I know the high level
details but if you ask me specifics like
okay how does again when you allocate a
block of memory in C C++ using ml ock
right what functions does ml are
internally call imagine if I am using
let's say Linux operating system within
the Linux operating system what
functions exactly is Linux is ml are
calling or if I'm using the Macintosh or
the Mac OS what functions is it exactly
calling how does the C compiler work
internally again there is this whole
thing of compiler design that also come
in here right so there are lot of
designs my question here is where do you
stop at an undergraduate level in
computer science you are given a broad
overview of many of these concepts right
imagine if I am if I'm developing a
compiler for Python right or if I am
developing a compiler sorry if I'm
developing a compiler for C C++ then I
have to read the whole compiler design
textbook then if the famous dragon book
write and explain this concepts in depth
and I have to know many more things if
I'm designing the compiler because if I
am designing a compiler for Linux for C
C++ on Linux I have been a lot of Linux
internal functionality how does Lucas
work how do loaders work there is a ton
of thing again I know some of these
thing
because I've refreshed it recently I've
also taught gait computer science where
I taught all undergraduate core subjects
right but if you have not worked in a
field it's very common to forget it
so in machine learning knowing these
things is good but knowing these things
will not help you solve the problem at
hand suppose if your problem is okay I
want to predict what the sales of the
company next year is right you want to
build a time series forecasting problem
knowing these things is great if you
know it but then your problem is not
knowing these things your problem is to
use existing functionality and to solve
the problem at hand that's what a
machine learning engineer that's what is
expected out of it but if you have
studied undergraduate computer science
you will have some high-level knowledge
of all of them if not in depth knowledge
you can only gain in-depth knowledge by
actually implementing it if you have
implemented a compiler of your own you
will learn it if you have built an
operating system of your own you know it
if you have designed a computer
architecture if you've built actual like
if you if you have if you have worked on
eight zero eight five eight zero eight
six Pentium the other processors or ARM
processors only then you understand the
core hardware nobody can be an expert in
everything so it's okay to use existing
functionality right okay so again I'm
just scrolling yeah somebody is asking
do you plan to cover PI spark in future
sessions we want to cover PI spark but
in the context of machine learning only
right so because PI spark itself is like
a massive thing like teaching somebody
whole of distributor again what our
teaching philosophy at apply da course
has always been when we teach something
we want to go into the internals as much
as possible and do it and the objective
again we have done a spell session
called how to use spark for machine
learning applications right we have done
we have done a live session on this we
were thinking that in the future
sessions we will focus on using spark
again using spark for the core tasks
that you have in machine learning for
example can you build a data pipeline
do you build a data pipeline in spark
right of course remember you I'm
assuming that you know SQL so there is
something called a spark SQL so we will
build it in the most popular way which
is Park SQL instead of writing coding PI
spark it is much more easy to write to
build data pipelines in spark SQL so we
will do that right next if you want to
do let's say let's assume you want to do
you want to build some machine learning
models in a distributed fashion now I
can implement these machine learning
models in raw pi spark but why do it
there are already beautiful libraries
like spark ml Lib which we can use right
so we want to cover spark from a
applicative perspective on applications
that are most relevant in the context of
machine learning because PI spark is
much broader if I have to teach PI spark
or even spark to its core I think for
software engineering or distributed
systems applications again for machine
learning applications it's very simple
because people already know how machine
learning models work they have seen a
bunch of libraries like tensorflow
scikit-learn and XG boost they have seen
a bunch of libraries right they know how
the mathematics internally works so now
we just simply using ml live with some
of course there are some spark specific
things that they have to know but they
don't have to be experts at PI spark
right they don't have to know the
internals of how spark distributed
computing actually works they don't have
to know how ardently how rdd's work
internally in spark so again most
machine learning folks use Park
mostly for building data pipelines for
building machine learning models and for
some data analysis and for some data
analysis so we will cover spark from
this perspective not from a software
development engineer or not from a
distributed systems engineer perspective
right because that's a whole course onto
itself
this we can't cover in two or three live
sessions this we can cover in a few live
sessions okay sounds good so
if you write a class then how other
people are able to use that class so you
should just check yesterday's live
session so in yesterday's live session
we did this right we took again we just
took a library so I gave this example
yesterday which is I built a URL
shortener called URL short URL final
right let's assume this is there in a
library right right if somebody wants to
change the functionality of it partially
then in yesterday's session I created my
URL shortener right as as a derived
class from this base class so this was
my base class this was my derived class
I wanted to use most of the
functionality of this class but change a
couple of things whatever I wanted to
change I just used inheritance I got all
the functionality here I change whatever
functionality I wanted that's how you
extend or you inherit a class and modify
it to your needs
so somebody says do you recommend any
certification for python specifically
for data science and machine learning I
don't know you need to be honest with
you again certifications which are
proctored by mean by what by which I
mean anyway so I again in the industry
certificates especially a product based
company certificates don't matter much
to be honest with you but there are some
certifications which are proctored which
means there is an in visitor right so
there is an in visit and you have to go
to a test center and write a test these
are given more preference so you have to
go to a test center so that there is no
cheating right so there is no cheating
the test is conducted in a proper manner
so those are those those tests tend to
have higher Vantage and Industry number
one member to the test also has to be
has to have a high bar it should have a
high bar if the test is like trivial
test then the certificate is useless
right see in the real world recruiters
say given a certificate can I trust that
certificate which can only be trusted
today most of the most of the cases
where it's trusted is where
there is a proctored or a envision lated
exam in a physical location so
recruiters respect that or companies
respect that and the bar has to be high
there are some certifications which are
actually most certifications don't have
a high bar and most certifications are
not proctored or in visited in a test
center that's why most product based
companies don't care there are again
four for distributed systems and cloud
computing there are some certificates
that I know of there are some
certificates by AWS and by asier
where you have to go to a test center
and you have to write those tests and
these certifications are somewhat
respected by the industry but again the
bar for them is okay not not too good
the bar for again I've seen some of
these tests even for machine learning
the bar was okay it was it cannot
measure if you're a really good again it
doesn't give you that scale that this
guy is a brilliant machine learning
engineer
this guy is an average guy etc because
both the average guys and the brilliant
guys get roughly the same marks right so
some of these certificate if you are
applying for a machine learning role in
some of these top product based
companies I don't think any of the
certificates that I know of again my
knowledge is limited here though any of
the certificates are really really that
useful for for Python or for anything so
are NPTEL certificates worthy again I've
never seen any company taking NPTEL
certificate seriously because again they
have the same problem right is the exam
high bar is the exam being conducted in
a proctored or in related manner if it's
not nobody cares to be honest with you
again I have done I have done quite a
lot of interviews and I have seen people
send me all sorts of certificates from a
bunch of MOOCs and I don't think the
recruiter ever used those MOOC
certificates as a criteria to conduct an
interview
I don't think so to the best of my
knowledge
so if getting a call for Python not ml
so is it good for that so you're saying
the certifications again what
certification are you talking about any
certification that you take just make
sure in the real world guys let's get
let's get real right it is the it is a
exams with high bar any exam any exam in
the world where the bar is high where
the exams are proctored proctored
basically means there is an inn visitor
right and there is very low scope for
cheating only when these two conditions
are satisfied that the certificate has a
value it could be even be your degree
certificate right suppose suppose you
have a degree certificate or a or a
bachelor's degree certificate from
little IIT Bombay or you have a master's
degree certificate from ISC people know
that the examinations at IITs and IISc
are quite hard they are not trivial by
any means and all the examinations are
proctored so somebody who has gotten a
nine out of ten C GPA or nine point five
out of ten C GPA or in the case of ISC
the cg pays are all out of it somebody
who got seven point two out of eight
CGPA those guys have cleared a very high
bar and exams are proctored and
invigilator that's why these
certificates have a high bar on the
other hand take some university take a
Tier three university take or TA I don't
want to name any universities take a
Tier three university yes I'm happy that
the exams are proctored right I'm
assuming that very little cheating is
happening again most universities in
India are truthful to this matter but
the examination bar is too low they'll
just ask you some theory questions like
I have studied in a small university I
may not be able to call it tier three
but it's it's a small university in a
small Engineering College in the
examination for recursion I will be
asked to write recursion for Fibonacci
that's a joke guys that's a textbook
example at IIT you will be given a real
hard problem and you'll be told okay
write the recursive function for this do
the time complexity analysis do the
space complexity analysis we were asked
write the program for Fibonacci so the
examination is low bar
that's why universities even though they
give degrees which are proctored the
degrees don't have high value that's the
problem
this is true across the world not just
in India if somebody graduates from
Stanford right stand for exams are
really high quality their coursework
you have to do real-world projects to
get through and all of them are very
well proctored their process is terrific
if you are found cheating on any of your
assignments they'll simply throw your of
the university first time they'll give a
one in second time they'll throw you out
of the University right so they have a
very high bar of exams and they're
proctored that's why there is value in
the certificate this is true for any
certificate whether it is given by a
university a company anybody even in our
apply day a course we try to maintain
the high bar through our assignments
right we try to maintain it using
assignments and we also we don't have
real-time proctoring but we check for
each of our assignments if there is any
plagiarism we just we just don't give a
certificate this is one of the ways that
we figured out again we're also
experimenting right so we also have this
platform called master ego which we
build right so in master ego we can
conduct tests again this is still an
experimental platform that we are
working on wherein will give high
quality tests and we will Proctor them
using your webcam we'll do screen
recording we'll do webcam recording and
we have actual humans and deep learning
systems that will actually evaluate to
see if there is any cheating if there is
even a suspicion of cheating we do not
give a certificate again I think online
methods are also slowly evolving to
create high quality proctoring because
giving a high bar test is easy right
it's the same test whether you take it
offline or online is easy but online
proctoring and invitation is I think the
future because then more and more people
can get high quality certificates low
quality certificates are useless right
so I hope I hope you understand that
sounds good okay folks thank you very
much for joining in will again please
please stay please just follow us on on
youtube if you want to know about future
live sessions again we'll make these
announcements slowly as and when we have
the next set of topics that are ready
okay thank you very much bye bye
