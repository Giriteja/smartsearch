hey folks uh I think I'm life so let's
let me just check if the audio and
everything is working properly or not
just give me a sec I'll be back so let's
let me just check him properly or not
yeah
the life seems to be good no hiccups
with audio everything seems to be
working well so let's get started I
think yeah I'm little early by a minute
or so I'll wait for others to join in
and we have a massive stream of
questions that came in since we put out
the video yesterday I think we have over
100 comments I'll try to answer as many
as possible so let's say let's just wait
for everyone to join them just give us a
few minutes hey folks our thank you to
those folks who are joining in right now
also on also on the chat so yeah let
just give us a couple of minutes so that
everyone who is willing who is wishing
to join or who's planning to join could
join in so we'll wait for a couple of
minutes before we kick off good morning
folks thank you for joining on a Sunday
morning thanks a lot for some of you
this may be a long weekend of sorts so
yeah so let's do one thing folks uh what
we'll get started with is in the video
that we pushed out yesterday there are
there are a flood of comments out there
there are over 100 comments many of them
have multiple uploads and stuff like
that so we'll split our time the 90
minutes that we have we'll split it
between the comments especially the top
voted questions in the video that I
posted yesterday and the live session so
we'll try and we'll try and balance
between both so that we do justice to
both sides of people people who put in
the questions in the comment section
yesterday and people who are putting in
the questions in the live chat right
I'll try and balance between both okay
so while others join in let's wait till
1003 it's 10:01 in in Standard Time so I
know some of you are joining from from
US and Europe sorry I understand it's a
late night session thank you for joining
in we had to cater to the lot we had
take a majority vote and since the
largest number of audience are in India
we had to pick a time that is convenient
to them sorry for that so let's get
going okay so what I'll do here is I'll
try and so first I'll go to the comment
section in the video that I that we
posted yesterday because there are a lot
of very interesting comments with lots
of up words there the reason we put out
that video is because we can get a sense
of what questions most people want us to
answer so I'll try to start answering
there and in between I'll swap and I'll
come to the live chat itself right and
please understand that it's almost
impossible for us to answer every
question right we have hundreds of
students who have joined in it's almost
impossible for us to answer hundreds or
even thousands of questions in a
90-minute session so we'll try and do
our best and that's the reason we wanted
you to talk food in the video that we
posted yesterday okay so it's 10:02 but
let's let's get started I have the
questions here okay so this is the video
that we posted yesterday let me just
refresh it to see if there is any
comment that is missing okay so we have
one not one come in so I think yeah so
let me go one by one okay so I'm simply
sorting it by swatting it by top
comments as YouTube finds it the top
comment and I'm going to go down that
list okay the first question here I
think this is by Rahman and it says are
there lots of upwards they're like 26 up
votes for that question so it has two
parts so I'll go one by one okay I think
if I'm not wrong Rahman is an
experienced professional he has two
parts in the question the first question
is after completing the course how
should I prepare for the interview so
ramen the most important thing is you
don't prepare for interviews after you
finish the course you prepare for
interviews while doing the course and
the structure we have at applied a
course right now as you might already be
aware of but let me just clarify it is
the moment you finished 15 assignments
you will have one mock interview this
mock interview is by one of your
teammates or one of our advisers and
this would consists of 50% programming
basic data analysis etc 50% machine
learning and deep learning and other
stuff the tips that you have already
finished in assignments so this will get
a give us give you a flavor of what
types of interviews
we'll be there because you could have
two types of interviews broadly one
based on programming the other based on
machine learning and deep learning so
this will give you first flavor of how
interviews would be this would also give
us a sense of where you stand okay based
on that we can we can hand hold you and
give you pointers on how to improve and
things like that that's the first
interview the second interview typically
happens after the 24th assignment
around the 24th assignment and that's
going to be much more deeper typically
one one on our farms of interview and
that interview will be much more focused
on machine learning deep learning
internals and these are interviews that
we conduct either buys by a member of a
team or by one of our advisors we're a
top-notch companies right so we do this
to interviews and through these
interviews we'll give you constructive
feedback on where you stand what you're
lacking where you need to improve and
all that stuff so you know additionally
we have a dedicated full-time team that
is responsible to help our students get
placed so they will give you interview
tips they'll tell you what are
additional material that you need to
prepare based on where you're lacking
for example I'll give an example
we've done some mock interviews recently
when we found that some students are
just copying and pasting code without
understanding what's happening
internally okay to complete assignments
so I believe one of these interviews was
done by me and we asked them simply what
is precision and recall a very simple
question I asked them explain what
precision recall in what what precision
is what recall is and what are they what
do they physically mean and what are
they mathematically a gentleman couldn't
answer this question and we immediately
told him dude you just can't copy paste
code from somewhere without
understanding what's happening
internally then you are just a coding
monkey okay you would you it's very very
hard for you to get a job even if you
get a machine learning job you would not
get a good job so we gave him
constructive feedback and said please go
back and learn concepts conceptually
the whole objective of assignments is
not to copy/paste code from somewhere
the whole objective of assignments is to
help you build the foundation strongly
and because assignments is an important
criteria doesn't mean that you not
understand what position and recall is
right so we give we gave that person
constructive feedback and told him
please prepare the math part also
because people will ask these questions
right in the real interviews people
would ask these questions and I'm not
asking a very high
I think this is something that we've
covered extensively in the course what
precision is what we call is and how
they work where should where should you
use precision recall where you should be
used a UC and all of that stuff right
it's a very foundational stuff
the gentleman thankfully took that
feedback went back provides his notes
came back well-prepared and he started
improving okay so we give a lot of this
constructive feedback to all of our
students through the process number one
number two is while you're back sit sit
from the time you finish your 15th
assignment we have a dedicated team
which is going to help you mentor you we
also have started these assessment tests
which are mostly self assessment tests
so that you understand where you stand
okay so we have tried again it's it's
very hard to simulate while we do two to
mock interviews we want to do more of
them so that you get a flavor of how
things work out right so on that front
we have also started these assessment
tests that we start giving to students
will finished 15 plus assignments these
are only for self assessment okay this
is help you understand where you are
lacking what topics you need to the wise
and all of them so your preparation
actually starts halfway through the
course and not even that even at the end
of every chapter we have a bunch of
revision questions if you're if you're
comfortable with these revision
questions and interview questions you
are preparing for the interview so I
would argue that you are actually
preparing for the interview from day one
right because at the end of him
you
hey folks are just wanted to know if
everything is alright
just give me a sec just give me a sec
folks just give me a sec I think I'm
back one second just lifting my right
hand to ensure that - just give me a sec
folks just give me a sec I think I'm
back okay
sorry folks are ya summer power cuts so
before before the inverter kicked in I
think there was a small delay if there
is any power cut I will be back within
two to three minutes I'm sorry for that
yeah sorry for that because yeah before
the inverter kicks in I think there is a
small delay excuse me so I extremely
sorry for this but anyway let's let's
get going since we are back okay so yeah
somebody's asking on the life that will
you help us prepare our resumes also yes
we do help you so that's why we have a
full full time team whose sole
responsibility is to help you get placed
right that's why we have the full fledge
team and it's not just it's not just us
what part of the core team were just
doing it right so again on the
placements front we have a co-founder
full-time working just to help students
get placed okay so your interviews
preparation actually starts from day one
having said that the second part of the
question is you have a notice so the
question says as my notice field is
ninety days most of the recruiters are
not ready for such a long time any
solution on this this all boils down to
negotiation I've done tons of
negotiations like this when I was hiring
for Amazon and stuff like that so
typically it boils down to two things
how desperate is the company that is
hiring you for you okay there two
possibilities here one if they're not
very desperate if they will willing to
wait you can negotiate the 90 days and
you can say I am willing to join I'm
even willing to put in the papers at my
current company you just got to be
patient or if you want me to join
immediately the better way is most
companies agree for a payback which
means imagine you have a 90 days notice
period okay
company a and if you're moving to
Company B Company B sometimes if they're
very desperate and they want you to join
immediately they're willing to pay maybe
60 days worth of compensation back to
company a right so that company I could
relieve you within 30 days and you can
join them it is something that you need
to negotiate with a charge at your
current company a and the next company
be it all boils down to negotiation
trust me okay there is no hack that I
can tell you and I've seen cases I have
hired people where they had 60 days or
45 days notice period and we wanted them
to join within 15 days then we would
simply offer them that okay we are
willing to pay your compensation to
Company A where you are currently
working for this 30 days or 45 days and
sometimes that works out because again
it all depends on the exact
circumstances right you got to negotiate
there is no shortcut there is there is
no fancy formula that I can tell you
here unfortunately this is all about
human relations and and negotiations
right but I believe I understand that if
companies have 90 days notice period
they also understand see if you are
applying from company to company B be
something that you can negotiate you
just got to be patient
instead of outright not saying I can't
do this say I'll try and work with the
HR at company a try to work out with
them sit with them explain your case
okay you got to be good to these people
you don't want to be harsh or you don't
want to be rude just be good be kind and
inform them your situation most likely
one of these two parties will budge
either the HR ed complain or HR at
Company B or your hiring manager or your
manager at company a and Company B they
will work it out and you can I mean I've
seen a lot of situations like this and
they can be made to work up because I've
been in one of the negotiation positions
there okay so that's that's what I would
recommend in this case so just a sec
okay so this is question one the next
question here so let me just look at the
live chat also here yeah there are some
questions about roles and
responsibilities of data science team
etc will come there okay we'll come down
okay
so folks yeah we'll try and answer as
many questions as possible as I told you
it's almost impossible to answer
everything to be honest and fair with
you let's go to the comment section in
the V
that people said yesterday the more the
second most popular in the ranking
scheme in his what is the scenario of
machine learning jobs for freshers in
india what can they expect and what can
they do in order to get into those roles
very good question actually
again there is also repeated question of
very similar types where people have
been asking that are there enough roles
for pressure freshers with or even for
experienced folks with no prior
background in machine learning and data
signs so the whole logic here is in the
marketplace itself while companies see
companies would always want people who
are a would prefer imagine if you have
two candidates candidate a and candidate
B let's assume both of them have the
same skillset both of them are roughly
very similar in terms of it in terms of
their skills if person a has two to
three years experience in data science
versus person B who has zero years
experience in data science either as a
fresher or he'll experience ends well
they would certainly prefer candidate a
right because he has prior experience in
data science and machine learning that's
obvious again here the condition is both
person a and person B have the same
skill sets on the other hand if your
person B who has more skill sets and who
can showcase his or her skills better
through the portfolio of projects that
you have done and through the through
the strength of the code bases that you
have written or through the through the
blog's that you've written or through
the videos you have written and stuff
like that right to the videos you have
made and all of that stuff if you can
build a stronger portfolio let's take
two cases right case a is a person with
two to three years prior experience case
B is a person with zero years data
science machine learning experience or
overall zero years experience but if
person B is more skilled than person a
and if person we can showcase that and
the best way to showcase is to work on
three to five projects take real-world
problems solve them end to end so please
don't take shortcuts please don't just
solve the kaggle competition problem
okay well that is that is the basic
thing solving problems end to end is
more important okay there are a lot of
people that I have seen who can only
build some model on top of data and give
you the output that's not sufficient for
a good data scientist or machine
learning engineer the end to end stuff
is required what does end-to-end mean
and - it means you start with the
business problem not the machine
learning problem you start with what is
the
this problem that the business wants me
to solve look at what are the metrics
that the business cares about okay also
find out what types of models are what
types of metrics should you optimize for
right then build do all of your basic
data analysis building of your models
and don't leave as soon as you build a
model then work on how to próxima is
these models how to maintain these
models in production how to update these
models in production right right some
production code so the best way to
showcase your end-to-end skills is to
write a block okay and the block should
contain everything you start with what
is the business problem who is the
customer here and what is the value
proposition that you are creating okay
and what are the metrics that the
business owners care about okay and how
what is it you're optimizing for in your
machine learning model and how does your
machine learning model optimize for what
the business cares about and then go
ahead and do all the data analysis all
the modeling everything which is just
one part of the bigger equation lot of
people think just building our fancy
model is all I have to do no sorry
that's only one component of the whole
data science lifecycle and that's what
we focus on at Apple idea course we have
done lots of tons of live sessions tons
of recorded videos and Prussian ization
of models how to deploy models in
production how to update models in
production all of those things they are
very very important because that's what
you would do in the real world right
that's what that that's part of part and
parcel of your day-to-day life right so
my suggestion is if your refresher you
got to showcase your skills better than
somebody who is experienced then you
certainly have operate and of course you
got to work on harder problems for
example let me also give you this right
and the three to five problems that you
solve try and pick various domains don't
solve all the problems in the same
domain don't solve all computer vision
problems don't solve all NLP problems
pick one problem from computer vision
one problem from NLP one problem from
from speech or audio write one problem
from traditional data right traditional
Tek tabular data okay one problem which
is which is more data analysis heavy
lots of analysis not so much of model
building right so by having a portfolio
which is very broad right your you you
will have and of course the harder the
problems you pick the more exposure you
can show okay the more versatility the
more
of experience you can show and of course
look at if I get two candidates like as
a hiring manager myself and even at
apply daily quotes we have had people
who are freshers who have shown that
skill more than experienced people who
cannot show that skill to me okay so a
lot of hiring managers have that if you
can show skills your chances are as good
actually even better than experienced
professionals right so it all boils down
to how much you can showcase your skills
the strength of your portfolio of
projects how well you have done your
portfolio of projects that's why they
deploy Deckard's we give so much
importance to assignments because
through your assignments you learn to
solve these real-world problems end to
end right and we even have two case
studies that we help you with minimum
two case studies and preferably more if
you are willing to put in the effort we
are willing to help you through the
journey right and these portfolios will
help you get significantly more exposure
and also more visibility and more
importantly an ability to showcase your
skills put in your code put in your
blog's
you
